Remember:
1. Always read summary file ./dev/summary.md first, that has context about the project, the files list, and description of file and content.
2. PLAN FIRST and ask user before implementing any feature or fixes or doing changes
3. Before making any changes, you MUST:
   - Create `./dev/tmp/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Create a detailed todo list in `./dev/tmp/todo_<feature_or_changes_title>.md`
   - Update the todo list diligently as you work
   - When completed, delete it, but ASK the user for permission first before deleting.
4. Anytime you make changes to ANY file in this project, you MUST update this summary file to reflect those changes. This includes:
   - Adding new files to the file structure section
   - Updating method/class descriptions if modified
   - Updating imports if changed
   - Updating the project overview if functionality changes
   But if changes do not necessarily invalidate any part of file, then there is no need to update the summary.
5. When getting error when implementing something, always ask the user first for permission to solve it with what you plan.
6. Follow coding best practices
7. You have access to AWS environment via CLI.
8. These requirements apply to ALL changes, no matter how small.
